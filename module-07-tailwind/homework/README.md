## Getting Started

### Step 1: Review the Starter Code

1. Navigate to `module-07-tailwind/homework/starter/src/`
2. Review the files:
   - `App.tsx` - Main component with task logic
   - `components/TaskItem.tsx` - Individual task component
   - `components/TaskInput.tsx` - Input form component
   - `components/FilterButtons.tsx` - Filter buttons component

### Step 2: Read Through the TODOs

Each file has TODO comments showing where to add Tailwind classes. Don't change the functionality‚Äîjust add styling!

### Step 3: Start with the Layout

Begin by styling the overall layout in `App.tsx`:
- Container
- Background
- Spacing

### Step 4: Style Each Component

Work through each component file:
1. `TaskInput.tsx` - Style the input form
2. `TaskItem.tsx` - Style individual tasks
3. `FilterButtons.tsx` - Style the filter buttons

### Step 5: Add Responsive Breakpoints

Make sure your design works on all screen sizes using `md:` and `lg:` prefixes.

### Step 6: Add Polish

- Smooth transitions
- Hover effects
- Focus states
- Shadows and depth

## Design Guidelines

### Color Scheme Suggestion

You can use any colors you like, but here's a suggestion:
- **Primary:** Blue (blue-500, blue-600)
- **Success/Complete:** Green (green-500)
- **Danger/Delete:** Red (red-500, red-600)
- **Background:** Light gray (gray-50, gray-100)
- **Text:** Dark gray (gray-700, gray-800, gray-900)
- **Borders:** Medium gray (gray-300, gray-400)

### Spacing Guidelines

- Use consistent spacing scale (4px units)
- More space between major sections
- Less space within components
- Breathing room around interactive elements

### Typography Guidelines

- Large, bold headings
- Clear hierarchy (size differences)
- Good line height for readability
- Responsive font sizes

---

## Running Your Code

### Development Server

```bash
npm run dev
```

The app will open at `http://localhost:5173`

### Testing

```bash
npm run test:module-07
```

Tests will check:
- Presence of Tailwind classes
- Responsive design implementation
- Proper use of state variants
- Component structure

---

## Example Design

Your final design should look something like this:

**Mobile:**
- Stacked layout
- Full-width elements
- Easy to tap buttons
- Comfortable spacing

**Desktop:**
- Centered container (max-width)
- Inline form layout
- Hover effects visible
- Generous whitespace

---

## Submission

When you're done:
1. Make sure all tests pass: `npm run test:module-07`
2. Commit your changes: `git add . && git commit -m "Complete Module 7 homework"`
3. Push to your fork: `git push`

Your teacher will review your work!

## Tips for Success

### Do's ‚úÖ
- Start with mobile styling, then add desktop breakpoints
- Use the Tailwind documentation frequently
- Keep class names organized (group related utilities)
- Test on different screen sizes
- Use smooth transitions for better UX

### Don'ts ‚ùå
- Don't write any custom CSS (use only Tailwind)
- Don't change the React functionality
- Don't remove or modify the TODO comments until you complete them
- Don't forget about hover and focus states

---

## Common Pitfalls

### 1. Forgetting Mobile-First

‚ùå Wrong:
```jsx
<div className="lg:text-base text-xs">
```

‚úÖ Right:
```jsx
<div className="text-xs lg:text-base">
```

### 2. Not Adding Transitions

‚ùå Without transition:
```jsx
<button className="bg-blue-500 hover:bg-blue-600">
```

‚úÖ With transition:
```jsx
<button className="bg-blue-500 hover:bg-blue-600 transition-colors">
```

### 3. Inconsistent Spacing

Use the same spacing scale throughout:
- `p-4`, `p-6`, `p-8` (not random values)
- `gap-4`, `gap-6` (consistent gaps)

---

## Bonus Challenges

If you finish early and want extra practice:

1. **Add Dark Mode** - Use `dark:` variants to support dark mode
2. **Add Task Priority Colors** - Different colors for high/medium/low priority
3. **Add Animations** - Animate tasks appearing/disappearing
4. **Add Drag and Drop Styling** - Visual feedback for draggable tasks
5. **Add Empty State** - Beautiful empty state when no tasks exist

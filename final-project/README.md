# Final Project

Congratulations on completing the 8 curriculum modules! Now it's time to apply your skills to a real production codebase.

## Overview

After finishing all 8 modules, you'll spend the remaining 8 weeks of the course working on a real-world project. This transition from structured learning to practical application is where your skills truly solidify.

## What to Expect

### Real Codebase Experience

You'll work on an actual production codebase, not a tutorial project. This means:
- **Existing code** - You'll read and understand code written by others
- **Real issues** - Work on actual bugs and features
- **Team collaboration** - Follow the same workflows as professional developers
- **Code reviews** - Get feedback from experienced developers
- **Production standards** - Your code needs to meet quality requirements

### Skills You'll Use

All the skills from Modules 1-8:
- Git workflow for collaboration
- HTML and CSS for building UI
- JavaScript and TypeScript for functionality
- React for component-based development
- Tailwind for styling
- Testing to ensure your code works

### What Makes This Different

**Tutorial Projects:**
- Start from scratch
- Follow step-by-step instructions
- Everything is explained
- No unexpected challenges

**Real Projects:**
- Large existing codebase
- Figure things out yourself
- Read documentation
- Solve real problems
- Ask for help when stuck

This is **much** more valuable for learning!

## Getting Started

### Step 1: Understanding the Codebase

Your teacher will provide:
- Link to the project repository
- Instructions for setting it up locally
- Overview of the project structure
- Documentation for the tech stack

Spend the first week:
- Reading the README and documentation
- Running the project locally
- Exploring the codebase
- Understanding how everything fits together

### Step 2: Finding Your First Task

Start with beginner-friendly tasks labeled `good first issue` or similar. These are:
- Small in scope
- Well-documented
- Good for learning the codebase
- Less critical if something goes wrong

See [task-examples.md](./task-examples.md) for types of beginner tasks.

### Step 3: Making Your First Contribution

Follow the [contribution guide](./contribution-guide.md) for:
- Creating a branch
- Making your changes
- Writing tests
- Submitting a pull request
- Responding to code review feedback

## Weekly Goals

### Weeks 9-10: Onboarding
- Set up the project locally
- Complete your first small task
- Get comfortable with the codebase structure
- Learn the team's workflow

### Weeks 11-12: Building Confidence
- Complete 2-3 small tasks
- Start reviewing others' code
- Ask questions to deepen understanding
- Take on slightly more complex tasks

### Weeks 13-14: Independent Work
- Work on features independently
- Help newer students
- Contribute to documentation
- Suggest improvements

### Weeks 15-16: Mastery
- Take on complex features
- Lead small projects
- Mentor other students
- Contribute significant value to the project

## Support System

You're not alone! You'll have:

**Your Teacher:**
- Available during class time
- Can help debug issues
- Reviews your pull requests
- Answers questions about the project

**Project Maintainers:**
- Review your code
- Provide technical feedback
- Answer questions via issues/discussions
- Approve your contributions

**Other Students:**
- Working on the same project
- Great for pair programming
- Can help debug together
- Share knowledge and tips

**Documentation:**
- Project README
- Contributing guidelines
- Code comments
- External documentation for libraries used

## Tips for Success

### Do:
- ‚úÖ Start small - don't try to tackle huge features immediately
- ‚úÖ Ask questions - there are no dumb questions
- ‚úÖ Read existing code - it's a great way to learn
- ‚úÖ Test your changes - make sure everything works
- ‚úÖ Commit frequently - small commits are better than large ones
- ‚úÖ Write good commit messages - explain what and why
- ‚úÖ Be patient - understanding a real codebase takes time

### Don't:
- ‚ùå Rush through tasks - quality matters more than speed
- ‚ùå Be afraid to ask for help - everyone needs help sometimes
- ‚ùå Skip testing - untested code causes problems
- ‚ùå Work in isolation - communicate with your team
- ‚ùå Get discouraged - everyone struggles at first
- ‚ùå Ignore code review feedback - it's how you improve

## Common Challenges

### "The codebase is overwhelming"

**This is normal!** Professional codebases are large and complex. You don't need to understand everything at once. Focus on:
- The specific file you're working on
- Related files that interact with it
- Asking questions about unclear parts

### "I don't know where to start"

Look for:
- Issues labeled `good first issue`
- Tasks your teacher recommends
- Small bug fixes
- Documentation improvements
- Adding tests

### "My code review has lots of feedback"

**This is good!** Code review feedback helps you:
- Learn best practices
- Understand the codebase better
- Write better code
- Think like a professional developer

Don't take it personally - it's about the code, not you.

### "I'm stuck on a problem"

Try this approach:
1. **Understand the problem** - Can you clearly state what's wrong?
2. **Research** - Search the codebase, docs, and web for similar issues
3. **Experiment** - Try different approaches
4. **Ask for help** - After trying for 30-60 minutes

## Success Metrics

You'll know you're succeeding when:
- üìà Your pull requests are getting approved
- üí° You understand more of the codebase each week
- ü§ù You can help other students with their questions
- üöÄ You're taking on more complex tasks
- üòä You feel more confident as a developer

## Beyond the Course

This final project phase prepares you for:
- **Open source contributions** - Many projects welcome contributors
- **Internships** - You'll have real project experience
- **Personal projects** - You can build your own ideas
- **Continued learning** - You'll know how to learn new technologies

The skills you develop working on a real codebase are invaluable and will serve you throughout your programming journey.

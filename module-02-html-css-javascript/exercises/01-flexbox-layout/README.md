# Exercise 1: Flexbox Navigation Bar

**Difficulty:** ⭐⭐ Medium
**Estimated Time:** 30-45 minutes
**Skills:** Flexbox, alignment, spacing

## Objective

Create a responsive navigation bar using Flexbox that has:
- A logo on the left
- Navigation links in the center
- A search button on the right
- Proper spacing and alignment

## Instructions

1. Open `index.html` and `styles.css` in this folder
2. The HTML structure is already provided
3. Add CSS to make the navigation bar look like a professional website header

### Requirements

Your navigation bar should:
1. Use `display: flex` on the nav container
2. Have the logo on the left side
3. Have nav links centered
4. Have a search button on the right side
5. All items should be vertically aligned
6. Have appropriate spacing between elements
7. Look good on different screen widths

### Hints

- Use `justify-content: space-between` to push items apart
- Use `align-items: center` for vertical alignment
- Use `gap` or `margin` for spacing between nav links
- Try using Flexbox on the `.nav-links` element too!

## Expected Outcome

When complete, your navigation bar should look professional with:
- Logo flush left
- Links evenly spaced in the middle
- Search button flush right
- Everything vertically centered
- Consistent spacing

## Bonus Challenges

- Make the nav links change color on hover
- Add a subtle background color
- Make the search button styled like a real button
- Add padding to the entire nav bar

## Learning Goals

- Practice Flexbox layout
- Understand `justify-content` and `align-items`
- Learn how to align items along main and cross axes
- Build a common web pattern (navigation bar)
